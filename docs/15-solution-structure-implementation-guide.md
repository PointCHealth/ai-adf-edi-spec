# Solution Structure Implementation Guide

## 1. Purpose

This document provides detailed guidance for implementing the Healthcare EDI Ingestion & Routing platform using a **layered, domain-driven architecture**. It defines the structure, boundaries, and implementation patterns for each architectural layer.

## 2. Architecture Overview

### 2.1 Layered Architecture Principles

The solution follows a **5-layer architecture** designed for:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a distinct responsibility
- **Loose Coupling**: Layers communicate through well-defined interfaces
- **Independent Deployment**: Business domains can be deployed independently
- **Scalability**: Each layer can scale based on its specific requirements
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries enable focused development and debugging

### 2.2 Layer Responsibilities

| Layer | Primary Responsibility | Secondary Responsibilities |
|-------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Cross-Cutting** | Security, observability, configuration management | Compliance, governance, shared utilities |
| **Outbound Assembly** | Acknowledgment generation, control number management | SLA tracking, partner delivery |
| **Destination Systems** | Business logic processing, domain-specific workflows | Data persistence, outcome signaling |
| **Routing & Service Bus** | Message routing, event correlation | Load balancing, dead letter handling |
| **Core Platform** | File ingestion, storage management, infrastructure | Validation, metadata extraction |
