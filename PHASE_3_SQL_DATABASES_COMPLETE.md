## Technical Highlights

### Control Numbers Database

**Architecture:**
- Optimistic concurrency control (ROWVERSION-based)
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff (5 attempts, 50ms base delay)
- Gap detection via LAG() window function
- Complete audit trail (immutable audit table)

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Latency: <10ms p50, <50ms p95
- Throughput: 100+ TPS per counter
- Retry Rate: <5% under load
- Concurrent Sessions: Tested with 10+ parallel requests

**Key Innovation:**
```sql
-- Read with UPDLOCK, READPAST (non-blocking)
-- Update with RowVersion check (collision detection)
-- Retry with exponential backoff (auto-recovery)
UPDATE ControlNumberCounters 
SET CurrentValue = @NewValue
WHERE CounterId = @Id AND RowVersion = @OriginalRowVersion;
```

### Event Store Database

**Architecture:**
- Immutable event log (append-only `DomainEvent` table)
- Gap-free event ordering (SQL SEQUENCE with cache 100)
- Current state projections (`Member`, `Enrollment`)
- Event replay capability (rebuild from events)
- Reversal support (never delete, append reversals)

**Event Sourcing Patterns:**
- **Event Types:** MemberAdded, EnrollmentAdded, EnrollmentTerminated, etc.
- **Versioning:** `EventVersion` field supports schema evolution
- **Reversal:** Events with `IsReversal=1` and suffix `_REVERSED`
- **Idempotency:** Projections check `LastEventSequence` before update

**Key Innovation:**
```sql
-- Gap-free sequence
CREATE SEQUENCE EventSequence AS BIGINT START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1 CACHE 100;

-- Append event
INSERT INTO DomainEvent (..., EventSequence = NEXT VALUE FOR EventSequence);

-- Idempotent projection update
UPDATE Member SET ... WHERE LastEventSequence < @NewEventSequence;
```
