# AI Prompts Alignment Report

**Generated:** October 5, 2025  
**Status:** Misalignment Detected - Action Required

---

## Executive Summary

After reviewing the AI prompts in `implementation-plan/ai-prompts/` against the implementation plan documents, several **critical misalignments** have been identified that need to be corrected.

### Key Findings

✅ **Aligned:**

- Overall structure and objectives are consistent
- Security and HIPAA requirements are well represented
- AI-driven development approach is maintained

❌ **Misaligned:**

- **Repository Strategy**: Prompts reference "monorepo" but implementation plan specifies **5 strategic repositories from day one**
- **Timeline**: Some prompts assume 28-week timeline vs. 18-week AI-accelerated timeline
- **Technology Stack**: Minor inconsistencies in .NET version references
- **Missing Prompts**: Several prompts referenced in INDEX.md don't exist yet

---

## Detailed Misalignments

### 1. CRITICAL: Repository Structure Mismatch

**Issue:** The prompts in `ai-prompts/` reference a single "monorepo" structure, but the implementation plan documents clearly specify a **strategic multi-repository approach with 5 repositories from day one**.

**Affected Files:**

- `ai-prompts/01-create-monorepo-structure.md` (Title and content)
- `ai-prompts/README.md` (References to monorepo)
- `ai-prompts/INDEX.md` (Mentions monorepo)

**Implementation Plan Says (00-implementation-overview.md, Section 3.2):**

```text
Repository Strategy Decision: Strategic Repositories approach balancing AI optimization 
with operational scalability

Structure:
1. edi-platform-core/           # Core infrastructure and shared services
2. edi-mappers/                 # All mapper functions
3. edi-connectors/              # All connector functions
4. edi-partner-configs/         # Partner metadata
5. edi-data-platform/           # Data orchestration
```

**Recommendation:**

- Rename `01-create-monorepo-structure.md` to `01-create-strategic-repos-structure.md`
- Update content to create 5 repositories instead of 1
- Update README.md and INDEX.md references
- Modify directory structure prompts to be repo-specific

---

### 2. MEDIUM: Timeline References

**Issue:** Some prompts reference the traditional 28-week timeline instead of the AI-accelerated 18-week timeline.

**Affected Files:**

- `ai-prompts/README.md` (Refers to 28 weeks in several places)

**Implementation Plan Says (00-implementation-overview.md, Section 6.1):**

```text
High-Level Timeline (18 Weeks - AI-Accelerated)
Time Savings: 10 weeks (36% reduction)
```

**Recommendation:**

- Update all timeline references to 18 weeks
- Emphasize AI acceleration in prompt descriptions
- Update phase durations to match compressed timeline

---

### 3. MINOR: Technology Version Inconsistencies

**Issue:** Some prompts reference ".NET 9" while others might imply different versions.

**Current State:**

- Most prompts correctly reference .NET 9 Isolated
- Implementation plan consistently uses .NET 9

**Recommendation:**

- Verify all function app prompts specify ".NET 9 Isolated Worker"
- Ensure consistency in Bicep templates for runtime versions

---

### 4. HIGH: Missing Prompts

**Issue:** The INDEX.md references prompts that don't exist yet, marked as "Coming Soon".

**Missing Prompts:**

1. `07-create-dependabot-config.md` - Dependabot configuration
2. `09-create-function-projects.md` - Azure Function project scaffolding
3. `10-create-ai-prompt-library.md` - Additional AI prompts
4. `11-create-dev-setup-script.md` - Development environment automation
5. `12-create-shared-libraries.md` - Shared library projects
6. `13-create-partner-config-schema.md` - Partner configuration schema
7. `14-create-integration-tests.md` - Integration test suite
8. `16-create-monitoring-dashboards.md` - Application Insights dashboards
9. `17-create-operations-runbooks.md` - Operations documentation
10. `18-create-performance-tests.md` - Load and performance testing

**Recommendation:**

- Create these missing prompts following the established template
- Update INDEX.md with status (Created/Planned)
- Prioritize based on implementation phase dependencies

---

### 5. MEDIUM: Team Structure References

**Issue:** Some prompts may reference separate teams, but implementation plan specifies a **single DevOps/Platform Engineering team** of 6.5 FTE.

**Implementation Plan Says (00-implementation-overview.md, Section 7.1):**

```text
Team Philosophy:
- Full Ownership: Team owns the entire stack
- DevOps Culture: Build it, deploy it, run it
- Cross-Training: All engineers develop T-shaped skills
Total: 6.5 FTE - DevOps/Platform Engineering Model
```

**Recommendation:**

- Ensure CODEOWNERS prompts reflect shared team ownership
- Update approval workflow prompts to use team-based rather than role-based approvals
- Emphasize cross-functional nature in documentation prompts

---

### 6. LOW: Prompt Numbering Gaps

**Issue:** Prompt files jump from 06 to 08 (missing 07), and from 08 to 15.

**Current Sequence:**

- 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, [missing 07], 08, [missing 09-14], 15

**Recommendation:**

- Fill gaps with appropriate prompts
- Consider reorganizing numbering to match implementation phases
- Update INDEX.md to show logical grouping

---

## Conclusion

The AI prompts library is a **valuable accelerator** for the EDI Platform implementation, but requires immediate attention to align with the current implementation plan, specifically:

1. **Critical Fix:** Repository strategy (monorepo → 5 strategic repos)
2. **Important Fix:** Timeline references (28 weeks → 18 weeks)
3. **Enhancement:** Create missing prompts to complete the library

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days for one team member to complete all high/medium priority fixes.

**Risk of Not Fixing:**

- Developers following prompts will create wrong repository structure
- Confusion about timeline and milestones
- Missing critical automation for early phases

**Recommendation:** Prioritize fixes before Week 1 of implementation begins.
