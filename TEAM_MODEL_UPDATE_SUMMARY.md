# Team Model Update Summary

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Change Type:** Organizational Model Update  
**Status:** Complete

---

## Overview

Updated all implementation documents to reflect that the Healthcare EDI Platform will be managed by a **single, cross-functional EDI team** operating in a **DevOps/Platform Engineering capacity**, rather than multiple specialized teams.

## Key Changes

### Team Structure

**Before:**

- Multiple specialized teams: Platform Team, Integration Team, Operations Team, DevOps Team, Database Team, QA Team
- 6 FTE across specialized roles
- Team-specific ownership boundaries
- Handoffs between teams for different phases

**After:**

- Single unified **EDI Platform Team**
- 6.5 FTE operating in DevOps/Platform Engineering model
- Shared ownership across all components
- Full-stack engineers with T-shaped skills
- Team owns: infrastructure, applications, data, operations, security, partner integrations

### Role Consolidation

| New Role | Headcount | Responsibilities |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **EDI Platform Lead** | 1 | Architecture, team coordination, stakeholder management |
| **EDI Platform Engineer (Senior)** | 2 | IaC, Functions, partner onboarding, AI prompts, operations |
| **EDI Platform Engineer** | 2 | Full-stack development, testing, deployment, monitoring |
| **AI Agent Coordinator** | 1 | AI orchestration, prompt optimization, quality gates |
| **Healthcare EDI SME** | 0.5 | EDI standards, compliance, partner coordination |

**Total:** 6.5 FTE

### Philosophy

- **Full Ownership**: Team owns entire stack (infrastructure → applications → operations)
- **DevOps Culture**: Build it, deploy it, run it, monitor it, improve it
- **Platform Engineering**: Create self-service capabilities and automation
- **Cross-Training**: All engineers develop T-shaped skills
- **AI-Augmented**: Leverage AI for acceleration across all activities

## Benefits of This Model

### Operational Benefits

1. **Faster Delivery**: Eliminated handoffs between teams
2. **Better Quality**: Team owns quality end-to-end
3. **Improved Reliability**: Same team that builds it operates it
4. **Knowledge Retention**: No knowledge silos or gaps
5. **Flexibility**: Team members can shift focus based on priorities

### Team Benefits

1. **Skill Development**: Engineers gain broad experience across stack
2. **Career Growth**: T-shaped skills increase career opportunities
3. **Engagement**: Full ownership increases accountability and satisfaction
4. **Collaboration**: Single team culture promotes better communication
5. **Innovation**: Cross-functional knowledge enables better solutions

### Business Benefits

1. **Cost Efficiency**: Optimal team size with maximum capability
2. **Reduced Risk**: No single points of failure in knowledge
3. **Scalability**: Team can flex across priorities
4. **Responsiveness**: Faster incident response and feature delivery
5. **Quality**: Continuous feedback loop from operations to development

## GitHub Team Structure

### Simplified Team Model

**Before:** 5 GitHub teams

- `edi-platform-admins`
- `edi-platform-core-team`
- `edi-integration-team`
- `edi-operations-team`
- `edi-readonly`

**After:** 3 GitHub teams

- `edi-platform-admins` (EDI Platform Lead)
- `edi-platform-team` (All EDI Platform Engineers)
- `edi-readonly` (Stakeholders, auditors)

### Access Model

All EDI Platform Engineers have:

- **Write access** to all 5 strategic repositories
- **Shared ownership** of all components
- **Cross-repository** responsibilities

This promotes:

- Knowledge sharing across all areas
- Reduced bottlenecks
- Collaborative problem-solving
- Backup coverage for all capabilities

## CODEOWNERS Updates

All repositories now reference unified ownership:

```text
Primary Owners: EDI Platform Team
Secondary Owners: EDI Platform Lead or Healthcare SME (depending on repo)
```

**Key Change:** Removed distinctions between Platform Architect, Core Team, Integration Team, Database Engineer, Operations Team, DevOps Team. All collapsed into "EDI Platform Team" with shared responsibilities.

## Success Metrics

### Team Health

- Cross-training completion: 100% of engineers trained in all major areas
- On-call rotation: All engineers participate
- Incident response: Any engineer can handle most incidents
- Knowledge sharing: Regular demos and learning sessions

### Delivery Performance

- Lead time for changes: Reduced (no handoffs)
- Deployment frequency: Increased (team autonomy)
- Mean time to recovery: Reduced (operators are developers)
- Change failure rate: Reduced (quality ownership)

## Migration Notes

### If Teams Already Exist

1. Consolidate existing separate teams into single `edi-platform-team`
2. Update all repository permissions
3. Update CODEOWNERS files
4. Update documentation references
5. Communicate new model to all stakeholders

### Training Requirements

All EDI Platform Engineers should have or develop skills in:

#### Core Skills (All Engineers)

- C# / .NET development
- Bicep IaC
- Azure PaaS services
- Git / GitHub
- CI/CD pipelines

#### Domain Skills (Developed Over Time)

- X12 EDI standards
- Healthcare workflows
- Partner integration patterns
- Advanced Azure services
- Observability and monitoring

### Onboarding Path

1. **Week 1-2:** Platform overview, architecture, tools setup
2. **Week 3-4:** Pair programming on simple features
3. **Week 5-8:** Lead small features with review
4. **Month 3-6:** Rotate through different components
5. **Month 6+:** Full autonomy with specialization emerging naturally
