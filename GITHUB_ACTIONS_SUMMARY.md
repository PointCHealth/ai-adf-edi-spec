## Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Developer Submits Infrastructure Change

1. Developer creates feature branch: `feature/add-service-bus`
2. Makes changes to `infra/bicep/modules/servicebus.bicep`
3. Creates PR to `main`
4. **Automatic Actions:**
   - Infrastructure CI workflow triggers
   - Bicep build validates syntax
   - Security scans run (PSRule, Checkov)
   - What-if analysis against dev
   - Results posted as PR comment
5. **2 reviewers approve** (per CODEOWNERS)
6. **Merge to main:**
   - Dev deployment auto-triggers
   - Smoke tests run
   - Slack notification sent

### Scenario 2: Production Deployment

1. Platform lead navigates to Actions → Infrastructure CD
2. Clicks "Run workflow"
3. Selects:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Environment: `prod`
4. Provides change ticket ID in comments
5. **Approval Gate 1:** Security team reviews what-if output (5 min cooling-off)
6. **Approval Gate 2:** Platform lead approves
7. **Deployment executes:**
   - What-if preview logged
   - Resources deployed
   - Post-deployment validation runs
   - Release annotation created in Log Analytics
   - Teams notification sent to stakeholders

### Scenario 3: Drift Detected

1. **Nightly at 2 AM UTC:** Drift detection workflow runs
2. **Finds manual change** to storage account firewall
3. **Creates GitHub Issue:**
   - Title: "⚠️ Infrastructure Drift Detected - prod"
   - Body: What-if output showing changes
   - Labels: `drift-detection`, `prod`, `needs-triage`
4. **Platform engineer reviews:**
   - Determines change was emergency firewall update
   - Updates Bicep template to match
   - Creates PR with fix
   - Closes drift issue after merge

### Scenario 4: Emergency Hotfix

1. **Critical security vulnerability** in Function app dependency
2. Developer creates hotfix branch: `hotfix/security-patch`
3. Updates `requirements.txt`, pushes
4. Creates PR (expedited review)
5. **After merge to main:**
   - Dev deployment validates fix
6. **Platform lead triggers manual deployment:**
   - Workflow: Function CD
   - Environment: prod
   - Branch: `main` (now includes hotfix)
7. **Approvals expedited** (security + on-call)
8. Deployment completes, monitoring confirms fix

- Review GitHub Actions feature releases
- Validate federated credentials still active
- Audit unused secrets

### Semi-Annual

- Review workflow success rate trends
- Optimize long-running workflows
- Update composite actions
- Refresh cost optimization strategies

### Ad-Hoc

- After Azure platform changes (new CLI features)
- When GitHub Actions introduces new capabilities
- Post-incident reviews of workflow failures
