# CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

**Document Version:** 0.3  
**Last Updated:** October 5, 2025  
**Status:** Agent-Orchestrated Outline  
**Owner:** EDI Platform Team (DevOps/Platform Engineering Model)

## Purpose

Describe the standardized GitHub Actions pipelines that the EDI Platform Team uses to build, test, and promote all components. In the DevOps/Platform Engineering model, the team owns the entire CI/CD lifecycle.

## Key Topics

- GitHub Actions workflows (all repos)
- Build and test automation
- Security scanning (Snyk, Dependabot)
- Artifact management (NuGet packages)
- Deployment strategies (blue-green, canary)
- Rollback procedures

## Deliverables

- Auto-generated narrative covering each key topic produced by GitHub agents
- Backlog of unresolved questions captured as GitHub issues for asynchronous follow-up
- Machine-verifiable acceptance criteria tracked via automated checks

## Dependencies

- 03-repository-setup-guide.md
- 21-testing-strategy.md

## AI Collaboration Plan

- Orchestrate GitHub agents within Copilot Workspace to draft, refine, and validate content end to end
- Agents execute linting, compliance scans, and dependency checks before promoting changes
- Agents log outstanding clarifications and required context in the shared backlog for later resolution

## Next Steps

1. GitHub agent seeds the workspace with the updated outline scaffolding.
2. Agents execute content generation workflows per topic and auto-commit outputs.
3. Agents run validation suites and publish reports to the status dashboard.
4. Agents link supporting assets automatically as they are produced in adjacent workstreams.
