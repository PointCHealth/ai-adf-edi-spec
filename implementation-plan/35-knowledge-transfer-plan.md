**Document Version:** 0.3  
**Last Updated:** October 5, 2025  
**Status:** Agent-Orchestrated Outline  
**Owner:** EDI Platform Team (DevOps/Platform Engineering Model)

---

## Purpose

Establish the onboarding and continuous learning activities that enable the EDI Platform Team to maintain and evolve the solution. In the DevOps/Platform Engineering model, all engineers develop T-shaped skills across infrastructure, applications, operations, and partner integrations.

## Key Topics

- Onboarding guide for new EDI Platform Engineers
- Cross-training program for T-shaped skill development
- Core competencies: Infrastructure (Bicep), Applications (C#, Functions), Operations (Monitoring, Troubleshooting), EDI (X12 standards, healthcare workflows)
- Architecture decision records (ADR)
- Runbook library and incident response training
- AI agent collaboration and prompt engineering skills
- Partner onboarding procedures
- Continuous learning and knowledge sharing practices

## Deliverables

- Auto-generated narrative covering each key topic produced by GitHub agents
- Backlog of unresolved questions captured as GitHub issues for asynchronous follow-up
- Machine-verifiable acceptance criteria tracked via automated checks

## Dependencies

- 34-api-documentation-standards.md
- 31-operations-runbooks.md

## AI Collaboration Plan

- Orchestrate GitHub agents within Copilot Workspace to draft, refine, and validate content end to end
- Agents execute linting, compliance scans, and dependency checks before promoting changes
- Agents log outstanding clarifications and required context in the shared backlog for later resolution

## Next Steps

1. GitHub agent seeds the workspace with the updated outline scaffolding.
2. Agents execute content generation workflows per topic and auto-commit outputs.
3. Agents run validation suites and publish reports to the status dashboard.
4. Agents link supporting assets automatically as they are produced in adjacent workstreams.
