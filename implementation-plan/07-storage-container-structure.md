**Document Version:** 0.2  
**Last Updated:** October 4, 2025  
**Status:** Agent-Orchestrated Outline  
**Owner:** GitHub Agent Collective

---

## Purpose

Define the Data Lake Gen2 layout, naming, and lifecycle policies that underpin all partner file flows.

## Key Topics

- Data Lake Gen2 folder hierarchy
- Container naming conventions (raw, staging, curated, quarantine, config, metadata)
- Partition strategy (date, partner, transaction type)
- Access control lists (ACLs)
- Lifecycle management policies
- Retention and archival strategy

## Deliverables

- Auto-generated narrative covering each key topic produced by GitHub agents
- Backlog of unresolved questions captured as GitHub issues for asynchronous follow-up
- Machine-verifiable acceptance criteria tracked via automated checks

## Dependencies

- 05-phase-1-core-platform.md

## AI Collaboration Plan

- Orchestrate GitHub agents within Copilot Workspace to draft, refine, and validate content end to end
- Agents execute linting, compliance scans, and dependency checks before promoting changes
- Agents log outstanding clarifications and required context in the shared backlog for later resolution

## Next Steps

1. GitHub agent seeds the workspace with the updated outline scaffolding.
2. Agents execute content generation workflows per topic and auto-commit outputs.
3. Agents run validation suites and publish reports to the status dashboard.
4. Agents link supporting assets automatically as they are produced in adjacent workstreams.
