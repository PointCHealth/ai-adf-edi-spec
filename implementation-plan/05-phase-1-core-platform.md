## Purpose

Plan the initial sprint wave that stands up core ingestion, storage, and CI/CD capabilities across the platform.

## Key Topics

- Detailed sprint plan (Weeks 3-6)
- Infrastructure deployment sequence
- ADF pipeline development tasks
- Testing checklist
- Acceptance criteria validation
- Go/no-go decision criteria

## Deliverables

- Auto-generated narrative covering each key topic produced by GitHub agents
- Backlog of unresolved questions captured as GitHub issues for asynchronous follow-up
- Machine-verifiable acceptance criteria tracked via automated checks

## Dependencies

- 00-implementation-overview.md
- 01-infrastructure-projects.md
- 03-repository-setup-guide.md
- 04-development-environment-setup.md

## AI Collaboration Plan

- Orchestrate GitHub agents within Copilot Workspace to draft, refine, and validate content end to end
- Agents execute linting, compliance scans, and dependency checks before promoting changes
- Agents log outstanding clarifications and required context in the shared backlog for later resolution

## Next Steps

1. GitHub agent seeds the workspace with the updated outline scaffolding.
2. Agents execute content generation workflows per topic and auto-commit outputs.
3. Agents run validation suites and publish reports to the status dashboard.
4. Agents link supporting assets automatically as they are produced in adjacent workstreams.
