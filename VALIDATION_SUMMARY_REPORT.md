## Key Improvement Areas

### 1. Trading Partner Terminology (CRITICAL)

**Issue**: Inconsistent use of "destination system", "subsystem", "claim system", "trading partner"

**Impact**: 
- Confuses unified architectural model
- Makes documents harder to navigate
- Obscures key design principle

**Resolution**:
- AI overview updated with clear trading partner abstraction
- Follow-up needed in Docs 08, 13, 01, 02, 11

**Priority**: HIGH - affects architectural understanding

### 2. Event Sourcing Context (MEDIUM)

**Issue**: Doc 11 could be misinterpreted as prescriptive

**Impact**:
- May lead to assumption all internal partners must use event sourcing
- Obscures that it's one partner's architectural choice

**Resolution**:
- Add prominent callout explaining pattern is a choice
- Emphasize other partners can use different approaches

**Priority**: MEDIUM - affects implementation decisions

### 3. Integration Adapter Specification (MEDIUM)

**Issue**: Doc 13 focus on mappers/connectors obscures trading partner integration

**Impact**:
- Partner integration pattern not clearly presented
- Relationship to partner configuration unclear

**Resolution**:
- Add trading partner model overview section
- Update all terminology
- Add partner type mapping examples

**Priority**: MEDIUM - affects implementation clarity
